# DQDanielMarc

App by: Marc-Daniel Dialogo and Daniel Cavalcanti

DQDanielMarc is a driving test app which will display to the user 4 different road sign images, alongside a text describing of those 4 images. The goal of the test is to select the image which corresponds to the text.
This app serves as a quiz, so there will be four different questions.
If the user is unsure of the answer, there is a 'hint' button which the user can press to do a Google search using the question text as the query.
Once the user has completed the quiz, his score will be saved in another window, available by pressing on the 'about' button. The 'about' button will also contain instructions on how to play, as well as the credits.
